# Music Playlist Management System  

**About**  

The **Music Playlist Management System** is a Java-based console application that allows users to create and manage their music playlists efficiently. Users can add songs, remove them, rearrange their order, and play the playlist in sequential or shuffled mode. This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, including **encapsulation, class structures, and list manipulation** using Java.  

**Features** 

- **Create a Playlist** – Users can name and create their own playlist.  
- **Add Songs** – Add songs to the playlist by entering a title and artist.  
- **Remove Songs** – Remove a song from the playlist by specifying its title.  
- **Rearrange Songs** – Change the order of songs in the playlist.  
- **Play Playlist (Sequentially)** – Play songs in the order they were added.  
- **Play Playlist (Shuffled)** – Shuffle the playlist and play songs randomly.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple text-based menu for easy interaction.  

**How It Works**

1. **Run the program** – Execute the **Main.java** file.  
2. **Follow the on-screen instructions** – Choose options from the menu.  
3. **Create a Playlist** – Enter a name for your playlist.  
4. **Add Songs** – Provide song details (title & artist).  
5. **Manage Playlist** – Remove or rearrange songs as needed.  
6. **Play Songs** – Choose to play them sequentially or in shuffled order.  
7. **Exit** – Quit the program when finished.  

**Project Structure**

```
/MusicPlaylistSystem
│── Main.java         # Main application file (user interface & logic)
│── playlist.java     # Defines Playlist class (manages songs)
│── song.java         # Defines Song class (holds song details)
```
